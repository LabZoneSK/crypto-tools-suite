## About

If you do not want to spend your life behind the screen and checking status of your open orders than this snippet is for you. It just checks your open orders and if any order is closed during a tick than
it will notify you (by email).

The logic is following:
* Get your open orders
* Compare current orders with open orders from previous tick
* If there is difference, get order information and send notification
* Loop until closed

## Basic commands

Usage
---
 
Install all dependecies
 
```
npm install
```
 
Run the notifier snippet
---
 
```
npm start
```
